# Hand-Tracking-
This project tracks human hands in real time using OpenCV and MediaPipe at 30 FPS. It detects 21 hand landmarks, including fingertips and joints, and displays them on a live webcam feed. The system is fast, accurate, and ideal for gesture recognition, virtual control, and human-computer interaction applications.
